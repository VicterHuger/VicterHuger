### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Victor Hugo SimÃµes** and I am studying in a Bootcamp at Driven Education to become a **Full Stack Developer at December 2022**! I am also finishing my chemical engineering course at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro! 

In the past of **2 months of Bootcamp** (May 16th,2022) I could already have finished **8 outstanding web applications front-end projects**! 

I've been working with **React**, **Javascript**, **CSS** and **HTML**, but I have interests in learning others languages like **Node**, **Java** and **Typescript**. 

#### Some facts about me: 

- I am going to be a Chemical Engineer and a Full Stack Developer at almost the same date, difference of three months of each one graduation;
- I love to help people on their problems, whichever they are, but I do have a real interest to learn backend programming languages, even if I couldn't help people as much as I could in front-end;
- I have already programmed in Fortran Language at College, I was part of a research on a computational modeling of natural gas extraction!
